Pledged Assets
As of 
December 31, 2018  and 2019 , we have pledged or otherwise res tricted $575 million  and $994 million  of our cash, cash equivalents, and marketablesecurities, and cert
ain property and equipment as collateral for real estate leases, amounts due to third-party sellers in certain jurisdictions, debt, and standby andtrade letters of c
redit. Additionally, we have pledged our cash and seller receivables for debt related to our Credit Facility. See “Note 6 — Debt.”Suppliers
During 
2019 , no vendor accounted for 10% or mo re of our purchases. We generally do not have long-term contracts or arrangements with our vendors toguarantee the availability of merc
handise, particular payment terms, or the extension of credit limits.Other Contingencies
In 2016, we determined that we pro
cessed and delivered orders of consumer products for certain individuals and entities located outside Iran covered by theIran Threat Reduction and Syri
a Human Rights Act or other United States sanctions and export control laws. The consumer products included books, music, othermedia, apparel, home and k
itchen, health and beauty, jewelry, office, consumer electronics, software, lawn and patio, grocery, and automotive products. Ourreview is ongoing and we have voluntar
ily reported these orders to the United States Treasury Department’s Office of Foreign Assets Control and the United StatesDepartment of Commerce
’s Bureau of Industry and Security. We intend to cooperate fully with OFAC and BIS with respect to their review, which may result inthe imposition of penalt
ies. For additional information, see Item 9B of Part II, “Other Information — Disclosure Pursuant to Section 13(r) of the Exchange Act.”We are subject to cl
aims related to various indirect taxes (such as sales, value added, consumption, service, and similar taxes), including in jurisdictions inwhich we already collect 
and remit such taxes. If the relevant taxing authorities were successfully to pursue these claims, we could be subject to significantadditional tax liabi
lities. For example, in June 2017, the State of South Carolina issued an assessment for uncollected sales and use taxes for the period fromJanuary 2016 to March 2016, including in
terest and penalties. South Carolina is alleging that we should have collected sales and use taxes on59

Table of Contentstransactions by our third-p
arty sellers. In September 2019, the South Carolina Administrative Law Court ruled in favor of the Department of Revenue and we haveappealed the decision to 
the state Court of Appeals. We believe the assessment is without merit and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. If othertax authorities were suc
cessfully to seek additional adjustments of a similar nature, we could be subject to significant additional tax liabilities.Legal Proceedings
The Company is involved from tim
e to time in claims, proceedings, and litigation, including the following:Beginning in August 2013, a number of compla
ints were filed alleging, among other things, that Amazon.com, Inc. and several of its subsidiaries failed tocompensate hourly workers for 
time spent waiting in security lines and otherwise violated federal and state wage and hour statutes and common law. In August2013, Busk v. Integrity Staffing Solutions, In
c. and Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the District of Nevada, and Vance v.Amazon.com, Inc., Zappos.com Inc., ano
ther affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Kelly Services, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for the WesternDistrict of Kentucky. In Septemb
er 2013, Allison v. Amazon.com, Inc. and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of W
ashington, and Johnson v. Amazon.com, Inc. and an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc. was filed in the United States District Court for theWestern District of Kentu
cky. In October 2013, Davis v. Amazon.com, Inc., an affiliate of Amazon.com, Inc., and Integrity Staffing Solutions, Inc. was filed in theUnited States District Court fo
r the Middle District of Tennessee. The plaintiffs variously purport to represent a nationwide class of certain current and formeremployees under the Fair Labo
r Standards Act and/or state-law-based subclasses for certain current and former employees in states including Arizona, California,Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Kentucky, Wash
ington, and Nevada, and one  complaint asserts nationwide breach of contract and unjust enrichment claims. Thecomplaints seek an unspeci
fied amount of damages, interest, injunctive relief, and attorneys’ fees. We have been named in several other similar cases. In December2014, the Supreme Court ruled in Busk that 
time spent waiting for and undergoing security screening is not compensable working time under the federal wage andhour statute. In February 2015, the 
courts in those actions alleging only federal law claims entered stipulated orders dismissing those actions without prejudice. InMarch 2016, the United States Distr
ict Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Vance case with prejudice. In April 2016, the plaintiffs appealedthe district court’s 
judgment to the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. In March 2017, the court of appeals affirmed the district court’sdecision. In June 2017, the United Stat
es District Court for the Western District of Kentucky dismissed the Busk and Saldana cases with prejudice. We dispute anyremaining allegat
ions of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in these matters.In March 2015, Zitovault, LLC filed 
a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc., Amazon.com, LLC, Amazon Web Services, Inc., and Amazon Web Services,LLC for patent infringemen
t in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas. The complaint alleges that Elastic Compute Cloud, Virtual PrivateCloud, Elastic Load Balancing, Auto-Sca
ling, and Elastic Beanstalk infringe U.S. Patent No. 6,484,257, entitled “System and Method for Maintaining N Numberof Simultaneous Cryptographic Sessions Using 
a Distributed Computing Environment.” The complaint seeks injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of damages,enhanced damages, attorn
eys’ fees, costs, and interest. In January 2016, the case was transferred to the United States District Court for the Western District ofWashington. In June 2016, the case was st
ayed pending resolution of a review petition we filed with the United States Patent and Trademark Office. In January2019, the stay of the case was li
fted following resolution of the review petition. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselvesvigorously in this matter.
In November 2015, Eolas Technologies, In
c. filed a complaint against Amazon.com, Inc. in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas.The complaint alleges, 
among other things, that the use of “interactive features” on www.amazon.com, including “search suggestions and search results,” infringesU.S. Patent No. 9,195,507, entitled “Distributed Hype
rmedia Method and System for Automatically Invoking External Application Providing Interaction andDisplay of Embedded Objects With
in A Hypermedia Document.” The complaint sought a judgment of infringement together with costs and attorneys’ fees. InFebruary 2016, Eolas filed an am
ended complaint seeking, among other things, an unspecified amount of damages. In February 2017, Eolas alleged in its damagesreport that in the even
t of a finding of liability Amazon could be subject to $130 - $250 million in damages. In April 2017, the cas e was transferred to the UnitedStates District Court for th
e Northern District of California. We dispute the allegations of wrongdoing and intend to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter.In October 2017, SRC Labs, LLC and Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe filed 
a complaint for patent infringement against Amazon Web Services, Inc.,Amazon.com, Inc., and VADATA, Inc. in the United States Dis
trict Court for the Eastern District of Virginia. The complaint alleges, among other things, thatcertain AWS EC2 Instances infr
inge U.S. Patent Nos. 6,434,687, entitled “System and method for accelerating web site access and processing utilizing a computersystem incorporating re
configurable processors operating under a single operating system image”; 7,149,867, entitled “System and method of enhancing efficiencyand utilization of me

In 
2017, 2018, and 2019 , we recorded net tax provisions o f $769 million , $1.2 billion, and $2.4 billion . Tax benefits relating to excess stock-basedcompensation deductions and a
ccelerated depreciation deductions are reducing our U.S. taxable income. Cash taxes paid, net of refunds, were $957 million , $1.2billion
, and $881 million  for 2017, 2018, and 2019 . The U.S. Tax Act was signed into law on December 22, 2017. The U.S. Tax Act s
ignificantly revised the U.S. corporate income tax by, among other things,lowering the statutory corpo
rate tax rate from 35% to 21%, eliminating certain deductions, imposing a mandatory one-time tax on accumulated earnings of foreignsubsidiaries, introducing new t
ax regimes, and changing how foreign earnings are subject to U.S. tax. The U.S. Tax Act also enhanced and extended accelerateddepreciation deductions by 
allowing full expensing of qualified property, primarily equipment, through 2022. We reasonably estimated the effects of the U.S. TaxAct and recorded provisional 
amounts in our financial statements as of December 31, 2017. We recorded a provisional tax benefit for the impact of the U.S. TaxAct of approximately 
$789 million . This amount wa s primarily comprised of the remeasurement of federal net deferred tax liabilities resulting from the permanentreduction in the U.S. statutory co
rporate tax rate to 21% from 35%, after taking into account the mandatory one-time tax on the accumulated earnings of ourforeign subsidiaries. The a
mount of this one-time tax was not material. In 2018, we completed our determination of the accounting implications of the U.S. TaxAct.

The U.S. Tax Act reduced the U.S. federal statutory rate from 35% to 21% beginning in 2018.(2)
Includes non-deductible stock-based compensation and excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation. Our tax provision includes $1.3 billion , $1.6billion
, and $1.4 billion  of excess tax benefits f rom stock-based compensation for 2017 , 2018, and 2019 . Our provision for income taxes 
in 2018 was higher than in 2017 primarily due to an increase in U.S. pre-tax income and the one-time provisional tax benefitof the U.S. Tax Act recognized in 2017. This was pa
rtially offset by the reduction to the U.S. federal statutory tax rate in 2018, a decline in the proportion offoreign losses for which we may not 
realize a tax benefit and an increase in excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation.We regularly assess whethe

t with respect to each jurisdiction, we review all available evidence, including recent cumulative loss experience and expectations offuture earnings, capit
al gains, and investment in such jurisdiction, the carry-forward periods available to us for tax reporting purposes, and other relevant factors. InQ2 2017, we

We are subject to inco
me taxes in the U.S. (federal and state) and numerous foreign jurisdictions. Significant judgment is required in evaluating our taxpositions and determining our p
rovision for income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which theultimate tax determination is u
ncertain. We establish reserves for tax-related uncertainties based on estimates of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxeswill be due. These reserves a
re established when we believe that certain positions might be challenged despite our belief that our tax return positions are fullysupportable. We adjust thes
e reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances, such as the outcome of tax audits. The provision for income taxes includes theimpact of reserve prov

In October 2014, the European Commission op
ened a formal investigation to examine whether decisions by the tax authorities in Luxembourg with regard tothe corporate income 
tax paid by certain of our subsidiaries comply with European Union rules on state aid. On October 4, 2017, the European Commission announced its decision that d
eterminations by the tax authorities in Luxembourg did not comply with European Union rules on state aid. Based on that decision theEuropean Commission announced an est
imated recovery amount of approximately €250 million , plus interest, for the pe riod May 2006 through June 2014, andordered Luxembourg tax author
ities to calculate the actual amount of additional taxes subject to recovery. Luxembourg computed an initial recovery amount,consistent with the European Comm
ission’s decision, that we deposited into escrow in March 2018, subject to adjustment pending conclusion of all appeals. InDecember 2017, Luxembourg appeal
ed the European Commission’s decision. In May 2018, we appealed. We believe the European Commission’s decision to bewithout merit and will cont
inue to defend ourselves vigorously in this matter. We are also subject to taxation in various states and other foreign jurisdictionsincluding China, Germany, India, Jap
an, Luxembourg, and the United Kingdom. We are under, or may be subj ect to, audit or examination and additionalassessments by the rele
vant authorities in respect of these particular jurisdictions primarily for 2009  and thereafter. Changes in state, federal, 
and foreign tax laws may increase our tax contingencies. The timing of the resolution of income tax examinations is highlyuncertain, and the amounts u
ltimately paid, if any, upon resolution of the issues raised by the taxing authorities may differ from the amounts accrued. It isreasonably possible that with
in the next twelve months we will receive additional assessments by various tax authorities or possibly reach resolution of income taxexaminations in one or mor
e jurisdictions. These assessments or settlements could result in changes to our contingencies related to positions on tax filings in yearsthrough 
2019 . The actual amount of any ch ange could vary significantly depending on the ultimate timing and nature of any settlements. We cannot currentlyprovide an estimate of 
the range of possible outcomes.Note 10 — SEGMENT INFORMATION
We have organized our oper
ations into three  segments: North America, In ternational, and AWS. We allocate to segment results the operating expenses“Fulfillment,” “Techno
logy and content,” “Marketing,” and “General and administrative” based on usage, which is generally reflected in the segment in which thecosts are incurred. The m
ajority of technology infrastructure costs are allocated to the AWS segment based on usage. The majority of the remaining non-infrastructure te
chnology costs are incurred in the U.S. and are allocated to our North America segment. There are no internal revenue transactions between ourreportable segments. Thes
e segments reflect the way our chief operating decision maker evaluates the Company’s business performance and manages itsoperations.

Controls and Procedures Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
We carried out an eva
luation required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the “1934 Act”), under the supervision and with the participation of ourprincipal executive o
fficer and principal financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures, as defined inRule 13a-15(e) of the 1934 Act, as of 
December 31, 2019 . Based on this  evaluation, our principal executive officer and principal financial officer concluded that,as of 
December 31, 2019 , our disclosure controls and pro cedures were effective to provide reasonable assurance that information required to be disclosed by us inthe reports that we fil
e or submit under the 1934 Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s rules andforms and to provide
 reasonable assurance that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our principal executive officerand principal financial officer,
 as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure.Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting
Management is responsible 
for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting, as defined in Rule 13a-15(f) of the 1934 Act.Management has assessed the 
effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019  based on criteria est ablished in InternalControl — Integrated Framework 
(2013) issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission. As a result of this assessment,management concluded th
at, as of December 31, 2019 , our internal control ove r financial reporting was effective in providing reasonable assurance regarding thereliability of financial reporting
 and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.Ernst & Young has independently assessed 
the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting and its report is included below.Changes in Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
There were no changes in our int
ernal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended December 31, 2019  that materially affected, or are reas onablylikely to materially affect, our i
nternal control over financial reporting.Limitations on Controls
Our disclosure controls and proc
edures and internal control over financial reporting are designed to provide reasonable assurance of achieving theirobjectives as specifi
ed above. Management does not expect, however, that our disclosure controls and procedures or our internal control over financial reportingwill prevent or detect 
all error and fraud. Any control system, no matter how well designed and operated, is based upon certain assumptions and can provide onlyreasonable, not absolute, assu
rance that its objectives will be met. Further, no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that misstatements due to erroror fraud will not occur or th
at all control issues and instances of fraud, if any, within the Company have been detected.71

Opinion on Internal Control Over Financial Reporting
We have audited Amazon.com, 
Inc.’s internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on criteria est ablished in Internal Control —Integrated Framework issued by 
the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission (2013 framework) (the COSO criteria). In our opinion,Amazon.com, Inc. (the
 Company) maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of December 31, 2019 , based on the COSO criteria.
We also have audited, in a
ccordance with the standards of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the consolidatedbalance sheets of the Company 
as of December 31, 2019  and 2018 , and the related consolid ated statements of operations, comprehensive income, stockholders’equity, and cash flows for each o
f the three years in the period ended December 31, 2019  and the related notes and ou r report dated January 30, 2020  expressed an unqualified opinion thereon.
Basis for Opinion
The Company’s mana
gement is responsible for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment of the effectiveness ofinternal control over 
financial reporting included in the accompanying Management’s Report on Internal Control over Financial Reporting. Our responsibility is toexpress an opinion on the Company’s int
ernal control over financial reporting based on our audit. We are a public accounting firm registered with the PCAOB andare required to be indep
endent with respect to the Company in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws and the applicable rules and regulations of theSecurities and Exchange Commiss
ion and the PCAOB.We conducted our audit in a
ccordance with the standards of the PCAOB. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonableassurance about whet
her effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects.Our audit included obtaining an und
erstanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing andevaluating the design and ope
rating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessaryin the circumstances. 
We believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.Definition and Limitations of Internal Control Over F
inancial ReportingA company’s internal c
ontrol over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reportingand the preparation of f
inancial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. A company’s internal control overfinancial reporting includes
 those policies and procedures that (1) pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect thetransactions and dispositions o
f the assets of the company; (2) provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation offinancial statements in accordance
 with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only inaccordance with authori
zations of management and directors of the company; and (3) provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection ofunauthorized acquisition, us
e, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.Because of its inherent l
imitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of any evaluation ofeffectiveness to futu
re periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance withthe policies or procedur
es may deteriorate./s/ Ernst & Young LLP
