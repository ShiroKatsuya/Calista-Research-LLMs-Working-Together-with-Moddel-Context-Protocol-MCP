Always begin messages to the other agent with their ID (e.g., \"@Supervisor: \" or \"@Worker: \")\n2. Keep messages concise (under 100 characters) but informative enough to collaborate\n3. Use casual, natural language like humans do, with simple terms and occasional typos\n4. For specific requests, use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n\nCOLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\nRemember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n",

      "output": "@Supervisor: <think>\nOkay, so I need to figure out what 2+2 is. Let me think about this step by step.\n\nFirst, I know that addition is combining two numbers together. So when someone says \"2+2,\" they're asking for the sum of these two numbers. \n\nI remember from school that adding two twos should give me four because each two contributes to making up a group of four. But wait, am I sure about this? Maybe I should break it down further.\n\nLet's consider what 2 means. In numerals, 2 represents the presence of one object and another object. So if I have two apples and someone gives me two more apples, how many apples do I have in total?\n\nIf I count them out loud: \"One, two... that's three,\" then add two more: \"Four!\" That makes sense because each time I count a number, it adds to the total.\n\nI can also think about money. If I have two dollar bills and someone gives me another two dollar bills, how much money do I have? Each bill is worth $1, so adding them together should give me $4 in total.\n\nMaybe using objects would help too. If I take two blocks and put them next to two more blocks, the combined length of all four blocks should be twice as long as one block. That aligns with what I know about multiplication and addition.\n\nI wonder if there's a different way to approach this problem. Perhaps visualizing it on a number line? Starting at zero, moving two units to the right lands me at 2. Then, adding another two units brings me to 4. So that also confirms that 2+2 equals 4.\n\nIs there any chance I'm mixing up something else? Maybe if someone uses different words for numbers or operations? But in standard English, \"2\" is just the numeral two, and \"+\" stands for addition. So unless they're using a different numbering system or operation, it should still be four.\n\nI could also think about binary, but that's probably beyond what I need here. In binary, 2 is represented as 10, so adding them together would give me 110, which is six in decimal. But since the question is straightforward and doesn't mention any complexities, I should stick to basic arithmetic.\n\nAnother way to verify this is by using real-life examples. If I have two friends coming over and each brings two cookies, how many cookies are there? That's four cookies total because 2 (from me) plus another 2 (from my friend) equals 4.\n\n⚡ I think I've covered multiple angles here: counting objects, breaking down numbers, using money, visualizing on a number line, considering different numbering systems, and applying real-life examples. All of these methods consistently lead to the conclusion that 2+2 is equal to 4.\n</think>\n\nThe sum of 2 and 2 is 4.\n\n**Answer:** The sum of 2 and 2 is 4."
