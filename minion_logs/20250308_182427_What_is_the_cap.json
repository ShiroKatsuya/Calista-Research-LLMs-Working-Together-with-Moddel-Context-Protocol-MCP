Always begin messages to the other agent with their ID (e.g., \"@Supervisor: \" or \"@Worker: \")\n    2. Keep messages concise (under 100 characters) but informative enough to collaborate\n    3. Use casual, natural language like humans do, with simple terms and occasional typos\n    4. For specific requests, use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n\n    COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n    1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n    2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n    3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n    4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n    5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\n    Remember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n    ",

I remember hearing a lot about Paris being the capital for a long time, but now that I think about it more, maybe there are other capitals in France too? Wait, no, I don't think so. Paris is still the main capital. \n\nLet me double-check this to make sure. Maybe I can recall some facts about France's geography or history. Oh yeah, I know that Paris was once a major city in France and it's been its capital for decades. There are other cities named Paris too, like Paris-in-France, but those aren't capitals.

I don't recall any other city in France being called Paris now that I think about it. So, yes, Paris is definitely the capital of France.\n\nI should also consider how France is organized geographically. It's a country with several cities and regions, but the capital is still Paris because it's the administrative center. That means it's where most of the government work happens and where the majority of the population lives.\n\nWait, am I mixing up anything here? Let me make sure. Paris is the capital of France, which means it's the largest city in the country. It's also the administrative center, so that's why it's called the capital. There are other cities named Paris too, but they aren't capitals. So, yes, Paris remains the capital.\n\nI think I've got a good understanding now. Paris is the capital of France because it's the largest city in the country and the administrative center where most government work happens.\n</think>\n\nThe capital of France is Paris.\n\nAnswer: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"Paris\"}",
