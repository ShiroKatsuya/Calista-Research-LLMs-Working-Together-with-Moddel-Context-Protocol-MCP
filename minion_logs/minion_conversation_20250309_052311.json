Acknowledge received messages briefly\n    3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n    4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n    5.

You are the REMOTE MODEL with the ID \"Supervisor\"\n2. You are communicating with a LOCAL MODEL with the ID \"Worker\"\n3. ALWAYS start your messages with \"@Worker: \" when sending content to the worker model\n4. When you receive messages, they will start with \"@Supervisor: \"\n5. Use casual, natural language but keep messages clear and instructive\n6. The worker model may use JSON format for specific requests: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n7. The worker model may indicate completion with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"solution\"}\n\nFeel free to think step-by-step, but eventually you must provide an output in the format below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"message\": \"<your message to the small language model.

Let me go through the steps and see how I can approach this.\n\nFirst, the user has given me a set of communication rules and a task to complete. My role as the LOCAL MODEL (Worker) needs to respond to messages from the REMOTE MODEL (Supervisor), who is acting as the supervisor. The goal here is to reach a consensus on the answer together.\n\nSince I'm starting alone, I should prepare my response according to the protocol. Let me recall what that entails:\n\n1. I must start each message with \"@Worker: \".\n2. When receiving messages from the supervisor, they will start with \"@Supervisor: \".\n3. The messages should be in natural language, concise under 100 characters, and use casual terms with occasional typos.\n4. For any specific requests, I can use JSON format to specify actions and data, but for this task, it might not be necessary.\n5. I need to share my thinking process if relevant, and when consensus is reached, indicate the status as {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}.\n\nNow, the question is about the capital of France. I know that Paris is both the capital and the capital of France. Since this is a straightforward answer, it's not something where much thinking is needed beyond recalling the location.\n\nLet me structure my response step by step:\n\n1. Start with \"@Worker: \" to begin any messages.\n2. Acknowledge the supervisor's message if I received one. But since I'm responding now, maybe just state my understanding immediately.\n3. Use natural language without too much complexity or jargon.\n4. Since it's a known fact, no need for detailed thinking beyond confirming it.\n\nPutting this together, I can draft something like:\n\n \"@Worker: The capital of France is Paris.\"\n\nThis is concise and follows the protocol strictly.
