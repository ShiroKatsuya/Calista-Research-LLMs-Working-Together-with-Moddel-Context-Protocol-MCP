Always begin messages to the other agent with their ID (e.g., \"@Supervisor: \" or \"@Worker: \")\n2. Keep messages concise (under 100 characters) but informative enough to collaborate\n3. Use casual, natural language like humans do, with simple terms and occasional typos\n4. For specific requests, use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n\nCOLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\nRemember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n",

You are the REMOTE MODEL with the ID \"Supervisor\"\n2. You are communicating with a LOCAL MODEL with the ID \"Worker\"\n3.

The worker model may indicate completion with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"solution\"}\n\nFeel free to think step-by-step, but eventually you must provide an output in the format below:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"message\": \"<your message to the small language model.

      "output": "@Worker: That's a great question! I think it's essential to consider both factors when evaluating human behavior and its impact on the earth. While humans do have the capacity for destruction, whether it's an inherent part of their nature or driven by specific circumstances is a complex issue.\n\nIt's possible that humans' destructive tendencies are influenced by various factors such as:\n\n1. Environmental degradation: Human activities like pollution, deforestation, and climate change can lead to environmental degradation, which in turn can contribute to human suffering and conflict.\n2. Social and economic systems: The way societies organize themselves, including economic systems, social norms, and power structures, can perpetuate inequality, competition, and exploitation, leading to destructive behavior.\n3. Psychological and emotional factors: Humans are capable of experiencing a wide range of emotions, including fear, anger, and frustration, which can manifest in destructive ways when not managed properly.\n\nConsidering these factors, it's challenging to pinpoint whether humans' destructive nature is an inherent part of their biology or if it's primarily driven by external circumstances. I'd like to request additional information on this topic to better understand the context and provide a more informed response. \n\n@Worker: Please provide any relevant context or insights that might help clarify this issue."
