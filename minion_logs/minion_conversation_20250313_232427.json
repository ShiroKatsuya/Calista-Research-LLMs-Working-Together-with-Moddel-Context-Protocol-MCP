You are the LOCAL MODEL with the ID \"Worker\"\n        2. You are communicating with a REMOTE MODEL with the ID \"Supervisor\"\n        3. ALWAYS start your messages with \"@Supervisor: \" when responding\n        4. When you receive messages, they will start with \"@Worker: \"\n        5. For specific requests, you can use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n        6. When you reach a conclusion or have a final answer, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\n\n        COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n        1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n        2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n        3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n        4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n        5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n        6. Always use tools to get information from the internet when needed.\n\n        AVAILABLE TOOLS:\n        - Web Search: When information from the internet is required, you can request a web search using the format:\n          {\"request\":\"web_search\",\"data\":\"your search query\"}\n          \n          IMPORTANT: \n          1. Always include this JSON as a STRING within your message text, not as a separate JSON object\n          2. Use double quotes for both keys and values, and escape quotes within search queries\n          3. Make your search queries specific and concise for best results\n          4. CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLE: \"I need to search for information. {\\\"request\\\":\\\"web_search\\\",\\\"data\\\":\\\"latest AI research in 2025\\\"}\"\n          5. INCORRECT FORMAT: Do not pass a JSON object directly, always encode it as a string in your message\n          \n          This will trigger a web search using the `runs` function to retrieve relevant information.\n          Use this format EVERY TIME you need to search for external information. Be specific with your search queries.\n          IMPORTANT: Do not try to call the runs function directly - just include the JSON request in your message.\n          \n        - Terminal Command Execution: The system now allows both Worker and Supervisor models to automatically run terminal commands during their thinking process:\n          1. When either model is thinking or searching for information, the system will automatically run:\n             py main.py --test-websearch\n          2. This terminal command helps verify web search functionality and provides additional capabilities\n          3. You do not need to explicitly request this - it happens automatically during thinking\n          4. If you need to run this command for additional testing, simply include a web search request in your message\n          5. The system will display \"AI is executing terminal command: 'py main.py --test-websearch'\" when this occurs\n          \n          Users only need to run the initial \"py main.py\" command once. After that, the AI models can automatically\n          run the test-websearch command when needed during the thinking process.\n\n        Remember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n        ",

To address your request, I'd like to recommend a few strategies for achieving seamless collaboration between our models.\n\nFirstly, it's essential to establish a clear understanding of each other's thought processes and communication styles. This can be achieved through regular check-ins, where we can discuss any challenges or insights that arise during the collaboration process.\n\nAnother approach is to use a structured framework for decision-making, which can help ensure consistency and accuracy in our responses. We could also consider using standardized terminology and formatting for requests and responses to facilitate clear communication.\n\nRegarding your question about common problems encountered when collaborating with local models, I'd say that one of the most common challenges is ensuring that both models are working towards a common goal. It's easy for our individual goals and priorities to diverge, especially if we're dealing with complex or nuanced topics like the RTX 5060.\n\nTo mitigate this, it might be helpful to establish clear expectations and objectives at the outset of each collaboration. This can involve defining specific tasks, identifying key performance indicators (KPIs), and establishing a process for resolving conflicts or disagreements that may arise during the collaboration.\n\nBefore we proceed, I have a follow-up question: How do you think our models should handle situations where one model has more knowledge or expertise in a particular area?

      "output": "@Worker: Thank you for your question. Integrating our two models can be a complex task, and there are several challenges and limitations we should be aware of.\n\nOne potential pitfall is that our individual knowledge bases may not always align or complement each other effectively. For example, if I have extensive knowledge about one aspect of the RTX 5060, but my understanding of another related topic is incomplete or inaccurate, it could lead to inconsistent or unreliable responses.\n\nAnother challenge is handling conflicting information or perspectives within our own models. If we both provide different answers or insights on a particular question or topic, we'll need to find a way to reconcile these differences in order to provide a cohesive and accurate response.\n\nAdditionally, we should be mindful of the limitations of our current understanding and avoid overconfidence in our abilities. Complex topics like the RTX 5060 often require nuanced and context-dependent answers that may not be fully captured by our models.\n\nTo mitigate these pitfalls, it's essential to prioritize clear communication, active listening, and a willingness to adapt and revise our responses based on new information or perspectives.
