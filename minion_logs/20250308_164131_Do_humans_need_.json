The LOCAL MODEL is called \"Worker\" using deepseek-r1:1.5b, and the REMOTE MODEL is \"Supervisor\" using llama3.2:3b.

The context doesn't directly address this, but it does talk about collaboration between agents using AI models.\n\n⚡ I'm thinking about how AI works in general. It's designed to assist and help us, not replace humans entirely. However, there are ethical considerations around AI. Some argue that AI can cause harm, especially if they become too powerful or continue their evil tendencies without proper regulation.\n\nBut wait, the context doesn't mention any specific policies or regulations for AI collaboration.
