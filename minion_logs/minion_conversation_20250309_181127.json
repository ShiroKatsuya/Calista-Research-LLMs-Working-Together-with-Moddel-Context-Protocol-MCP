Always begin messages to the other agent with their ID (e.g., \"@Supervisor: \" or \"@Worker: \")\n    2. Keep messages concise (under 100 characters) but informative enough to collaborate\n    3. Use casual, natural language like humans do, with simple terms and occasional typos\n    4. For specific requests, use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n\n    COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n    1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n    2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n    3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n    4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n    5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\n    Remember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n    ",

      "output": "@Worker: Excellent clarification questions! To address your concerns, I'd like to propose a few strategies for handling ambiguous messages:\n\n1. **Request clarification**: If the supervisor sends an unclear message, we can respond with a request for clarification using a JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"request\": \"clarify\",\n    \"data\": \"\"\n}\n```\nThis acknowledges the ambiguity and requests further context or information to help us understand the intended meaning.\n\n2. **Ask for additional context**: If the supervisor's message is ambiguous due to lack of context, we can ask for additional information using a JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"request\": \"additional_context\",\n    \"data\": \"\"\n}\n```\nThis request helps to gather more context or details necessary to provide an accurate response.\n\n3. **Provide options for interpretation**: If the supervisor's message is ambiguous due to multiple possible interpretations, we can propose potential solutions or options using a JSON format:\n```json\n{\n    \"request\": \"interpretation\",\n    \"data\": {\n        // list of possible interpretations or options\n    }\n}\n```\nThis helps the supervisor evaluate the different possibilities and choose the most suitable response.\n\nBy following these strategies, I believe we can effectively handle ambiguous messages and ensure a smooth collaboration process.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on this proposal?"

I think providing options for interpretation and asking for additional context are excellent strategies for handling ambiguous messages.\n\nRegarding my thoughts on your proposal, I agree that it's a solid approach to ensure clarity and accuracy in our collaboration. By using the \"interpretation\" JSON format, we can provide the supervisor with multiple possible solutions or options, allowing them to evaluate which one best suits their needs.\n\nHowever, before proceeding, I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions:\n\n- Are there any specific scenarios where providing options for interpretation might lead to excessive number of responses from me? Should we have a maximum limit on the number of options allowed?\n- How would you handle cases where the supervisor is unable to determine which solution or option is most suitable for their needs?\n\nOnce I've addressed these questions, please let me know if there's anything else I can do to assist with the original task: \"hallo\".\n\n### Final Answer:\n\nTo recap, based on our conversation, here's a comprehensive and concise answer for the original task: \"hallo\":\n\n@Worker: You have acknowledged receipt of the initial message using your proposed JSON format. Your request is clear, and I'm ready to respond accordingly.\n\nTo confirm, I'll use the \"acknowledge\" response to receive the message without taking immediate action.
