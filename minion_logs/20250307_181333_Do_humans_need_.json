They might argue that their actions and thoughts are causing harm, so they want to take action against it. But then again, I also remember hearing about people who don't believe in such things and just live their lives without any big plans.\n\nI wonder if the idea of destroying the earth is even possible. From what I've heard, there have been some attempts at global disasters, like the Great灾难 in 1937, which was a massive disaster that caused significant damage. But those were more about natural disasters rather than human evil. So maybe the concept isn't as straightforward.\n\nI also think about the idea of humanity's role on Earth. We've worked together to protect the planet and maintain its balance. Without us, it's hard to imagine life being stable. But then again, if we start acting against nature or against each other, that could lead to chaos.\n\nOn the flip side, there are people who might see humans as a burden. They might argue that their actions should be controlled by higher powers or that they shouldn't have so much influence on the planet's fate. It's a tough spot because it's hard to say whether one group is better off than another.\n\nI'm also considering the possibility of some form of intervention. Maybe there are experts who suggest that certain actions could lead to a greater good, but I don't know if that's widely accepted or feasible.\n\nIn the end, this question seems complex and might not have a straightforward answer.
