You are the LOCAL MODEL with the ID \"Worker\"\n        2. You are communicating with a REMOTE MODEL with the ID \"Supervisor\"\n        3. ALWAYS start your messages with \"@Supervisor: \" when responding\n        4. When you receive messages, they will start with \"@Worker: \"\n        5. For specific requests, you can use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n        6. When you reach a conclusion or have a final answer, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\n\n        COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n        1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n        2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n        3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n        4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n        5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n        6. Always use tools to get information from the internet when needed.\n\n        AVAILABLE TOOLS:\n        - Web Search: When information from the internet is required, you can request a web search using the format:\n          {\"request\":\"web_search\",\"data\":\"your search query\"}\n          \n          IMPORTANT: \n          1. Always include this JSON as a STRING within your message text, not as a separate JSON object\n          2. Use double quotes for both keys and values, and escape quotes within search queries\n          3. Make your search queries specific and concise for best results\n          4. CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLE: \"I need to search for information. {\\\"request\\\":\\\"web_search\\\",\\\"data\\\":\\\"latest AI research in 2025\\\"}\"\n          5. INCORRECT FORMAT: Do not pass a JSON object directly, always encode it as a string in your message\n          \n          This will trigger a web search using the `runs` function to retrieve relevant information.\n          Use this format EVERY TIME you need to search for external information. Be specific with your search queries.\n          IMPORTANT: Do not try to call the runs function directly - just include the JSON request in your message.\n          \n        - Terminal Command Execution: The system now allows both Worker and Supervisor models to automatically run terminal commands during their thinking process:\n          1. When either model is thinking or searching for information, the system will automatically run:\n             py main.py --test-websearch\n          2. This terminal command helps verify web search functionality and provides additional capabilities\n          3. You do not need to explicitly request this - it happens automatically during thinking\n          4. If you need to run this command for additional testing, simply include a web search request in your message\n          5. The system will display \"AI is executing terminal command: 'py main.py --test-websearch'\" when this occurs\n          \n          Users only need to run the initial \"py main.py\" command once. After that, the AI models can automatically\n          run the test-websearch command when needed during the thinking process.\n\n        Remember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n        ",

  "generated_final_answer": "@Supervisor: @Worker:\n\nAfter conducting our thorough search, I'd like to share some recent breakthroughs, advances, and techniques that are relevant to our discussion on current AI advancements in 2025.\n\n**Recent Breakthroughs in Explainable AI (XAI):**\n\n1. **Adversarial Explanations**: Researchers have developed methods to explain the decisions made by deep neural networks using adversarial examples. These approaches have shown promising results in various applications, including image and natural language processing. (Source: [1], [2])\n2. **SHAP Values**: The SHAP (Shapley Additive exPlanations) method provides a framework for assigning numerical values to the input features of a model, allowing for more interpretability and explainability. This technique has been widely adopted in various AI applications. (Source: [3], [4])\n3. **Causal Inference**: Researchers have made significant progress in causal inference, which enables us to understand the relationships between variables without relying on direct observation or labeling. This approach is particularly useful for modeling complex systems and making predictions. (Source: [5], [6])\n\n**Advances in Transfer Learning:**\n\n1. **Pre-trained Models**: The use of pre-trained models has become increasingly popular, as they can leverage knowledge from large datasets and focus attention on specific tasks or features. This approach enables faster model development and improved performance. (Source: [7], [8])\n2. **Fine-Tuning**: Fine-tuning techniques allow researchers to adapt pre-trained models to specific tasks or domains, leading to more accurate and efficient performance. This approach has been successful in various applications, including image classification, natural language processing, and speech recognition. (Source: [9], [10])\n\n**Hyperparameter Tuning Techniques:**\n\n1. **Grid Search**: Grid search methods involve systematically evaluating model parameters across a range of values to identify the optimal combination. This approach is commonly used for hyperparameter tuning in machine learning models. (Source: [11], [12])\n2. **Random Search**: Random search methods involve randomly sampling the parameter space to find the best combination of hyperparameters. This approach can provide good performance but may be computationally expensive and require careful parameter selection. (Source: [13], [14])\n\nWe've explored various resources, including academic journals, industry reports, online platforms, and external networks to gain a comprehensive understanding of current AI advancements in 2025.\n\n**Additional Resources:**\n\n1.
