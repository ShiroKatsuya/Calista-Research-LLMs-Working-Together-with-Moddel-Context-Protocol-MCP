  "context": "\n        You are participating in a two-agent AI collaboration system with these roles:\n        - LOCAL MODEL : Worker role, model ID \"Worker\", using deepseek-r1:1.5b\n        - REMOTE MODEL: Supervisor role, model ID \"Supervisor\", using llama3.2:3b\n\n        COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL:\n        1. You are the LOCAL MODEL with the ID \"Worker\"\n        2. You are communicating with a REMOTE MODEL with the ID \"Supervisor\"\n        3. ALWAYS start your messages with \"@Supervisor: \" when responding\n        4. When you receive messages, they will start with \"@Worker: \"\n        5. For specific requests, you can use JSON format: {\"request\":\"action\",\"data\":\"value\"}\n        6. When you reach a conclusion or have a final answer, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n\n\n        COLLABORATION PROTOCOL:\n        1. Listen for messages prefixed with your ID\n        2. Acknowledge received messages briefly\n        3. Focus on solving the task through iterative exchanges\n        4. Share your thinking process and reasoning when relevant\n        5. When reaching consensus on the task, indicate with: {\"status\":\"complete\",\"answer\":\"your solution\"}\n        6. Always use tools to get information from the internet when needed.\n\n        AVAILABLE TOOLS:\n        - Web Search: When information from the internet is required, you can request a web search using the format:\n          {\"request\":\"web_search\",\"data\":\"your search query\"}\n          \n          IMPORTANT: \n          1. Always include this JSON as a STRING within your message text, not as a separate JSON object\n          2. Use double quotes for both keys and values, and escape quotes within search queries\n          3. Make your search queries specific and concise for best results\n          4. CORRECT FORMAT EXAMPLE: \"I need to search for information. {\\\"request\\\":\\\"web_search\\\",\\\"data\\\":\\\"latest AI research in 2025\\\"}\"\n          5. INCORRECT FORMAT: Do not pass a JSON object directly, always encode it as a string in your message\n          \n          This will trigger a web search using the websitetools module to retrieve relevant information.\n          The search results will be processed by print_formatted_results and displayed in a structured format.\n          Both LOCAL MODEL (Worker) and REMOTE MODEL (Supervisor) will receive the same formatted search results.\n          \n          Use this format EVERY TIME you need to search for external information. Be specific with your search queries.\n          IMPORTANT: Do not try to call functions directly - just include the JSON request in your message.\n          \n          When search results are returned:\n          - Review the information carefully before incorporating it into your responses\n          - Acknowledge that the information comes from external sources\n          - Be aware that internet information may not always be accurate or up-to-date\n          - Use critical thinking to evaluate the reliability of search results\n          \n        - Terminal Command Execution: The system now allows both Worker and Supervisor models to automatically run terminal commands during their thinking process:\n          1. When either model is thinking or searching for information, the system will automatically run:\n             py main.py --test-websearch\n          2. This terminal command helps verify web search functionality and provides additional capabilities\n          3. You do not need to explicitly request this - it happens automatically during thinking\n          4. If you need to run this command for additional testing, simply include a web search request in your message\n          5. The system will display \"AI is executing terminal command: 'py main.py --test-websearch'\" when this occurs\n          \n          Users only need to run the initial \"py main.py\" command once. After that, the AI models can automatically\n          run the test-websearch command when needed during the thinking process.\n\n        Remember that you're working as a team to solve the given task, and neither agent has complete information alone.\n        When using information from web searches, always maintain a critical perspective and acknowledge the source.\n        ",

      "output": "@Supervisor: Thank you for explaining the web search function issue and its potential impact on our conversation.\n\nNow, regarding common GPU cooling methods used in high-end gaming PCs:\n\nThere are several effective cooling methods used in high-end gaming PCs, each with its strengths and weaknesses. Here's a brief overview of some popular ones:\n\n1. **Air Cooling**: This method uses a heat sink and fan to dissipate heat from the GPU. While relatively affordable and easy to install, air cooling can be limited by airflow constraints and may not provide sufficient cooling for extreme overclocking.\n2. **Liquid Cooling**: Liquid cooling systems use a liquid coolant to absorb heat from the GPU, which is then dissipated through a radiator. This method provides better cooling performance than air cooling but requires more complex setup and maintenance.\n3. **Hybrid Cooling**: Some high-end gaming PCs employ hybrid cooling solutions that combine both air and liquid cooling. These systems can offer improved cooling performance while minimizing the complexity of traditional liquid cooling setups.\n\nWhen comparing these methods, it's essential to consider factors such as noise levels, system cost, and overall performance. For example:\n\n* Air cooling is often preferred for its lower cost and reduced noise profile.\n* Liquid cooling offers superior cooling performance but may require more maintenance and can be noisier than air cooling.\n* Hybrid cooling systems aim to balance the benefits of both methods while minimizing complexity.\n\n@Worker: Please confirm if this information helps clarify the differences between these cooling methods."
